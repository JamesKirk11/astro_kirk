My research focusses on understanding the chemical and physical properties of exoplanet atmospheres by combining the technique of transmission spectroscopy with detailed retrieval analyses.

I am leading several projects on ground-based telescopes, from acquiring precise optical transmission spectra of gas giants via the [LRG-BEASTS](./LRG-BEASTS.html) survey, to studying the atmospheric loss of exoplanets via [observations of helium at 1083nm](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200107667K/abstract) using Keck and Magellan, to obtaining high-resolution optical transmission spectra of hot Jupiters using [Magellan/MIKE](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003SPIE.4841.1694B/abstract). I am also an active member of the [ACCESS](http://project-access.space/) transmission spectroscopy survey of transiting exoplanets.
