I am a postdoc working with Dr. Mercedes Lopez-Morales at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian. 

I perform both low- and high-resolution transmission spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets. I am currently particularly interested in studying evaporating exoplanets via [observations of helium at 1083nm](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200107667K/abstract), searching for the alkali metals in hot Jupiter atmospheres using [Magellan/MIKE](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003SPIE.4841.1694B/abstract), and performing retrieval analyses of low-resolution transmission spectra gathered via the [LRG-BEASTS](./LRG-BEASTS.html) and [ACCESS](http://project-access.space/) surveys.

A full list of my publications can be found [here.](./publications.html)

I am currently a postdoc working with Dr. Mercedes Lopez-Morales at the CfA. 


**2014 October -- 2018 August: University of Warwick, UK - PhD Astronomy**

Thesis title: _Optical transmission spectroscopy of hot Jupiter atmospheres_ <br>
Advisor: Prof. Peter J. Wheatley <br>

A copy of my PhD thesis can be found on the University of Warwick's online archive [here](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/111014/).

Master's thesis: _Characterising the Protostars in the Herschel survey of Cygnus-X_ <br>
Advisor: Dr. Joe Hora 

I enjoyed a previous stint at the CfA thanks to the University of Southampton's scholarship scheme whereby I spent my final year conducting research at the CfA which formed my master's thesis.
